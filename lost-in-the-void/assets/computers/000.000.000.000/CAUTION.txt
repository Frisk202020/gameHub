1) You're navigating in these computers with your SOUL. This means that every event that would normally harm the computer will harm you directly instead !
2) I can't track where your SOUL is, so I can't prevent you from doing mistakes. 
3) Be cautious with the files you open: for instance, some executable files can contain Viruses that can corrupt your SOUL data thus shattering it (e-g you die).
4) Be careful with the IPs you visit : trying to go to a server you can't access may cause your SOUL to shatter (because it would no longer have a place to exist).
5) DO NOT OPEN A data.SOUL FILE !!
