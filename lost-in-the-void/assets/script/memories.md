I...
I remember who I am.
I'am Frisk Tale, 13 years old.
I came here to understand what happened to my brother, Chara.
He went as a test subject for the experiment of this EXolotl MUUSKE.
He said the metaverse was the only way of redemption.
But he never came back.

I was the only one to know where Chara went
But after days, weeks of Chara's absence...
Our parents gave up on searching.
They accepted Chara's disparition.
I think they deeply hope he's not dead.
But they still deeply suffer from the incident.
I kept the secret, as Chara wished...
But I didn't accept he was dead.
$3000$
I applied for EXolotl experiments.
I didn't seek revenge, I just wanted to find my brother, whether alive or dead.
Soon enough I was at the laboratory, I didn't tell anybody.
Chara already showed me how dangerous this place would be, but by being cautious I was sure I could survive this.
$1000$
I think I have enough proof now that...
That Chara is dead...
$3000$
Now, I just need to get out of here.
I just want to get out alive.
I just need this scientist psycho to let my SOUL, or whatever it's called, intact.
Now's the final act...
*END*
