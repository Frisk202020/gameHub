What are you talking about ?
BEGIN OTHER
Oh Frisk, you're here !
And you seem to remember all of what happened earlier !
At least you seem less confused than last time...
Anaway, your SOUL seems quite stable now.
You seem to have plenty of questions to ask me...
I'm sorry for being so uncooperative earlier, but I had to make sure we indeed had this time to talk.
But enough of me monologing, what do you need to know about this situation ?
BEGIN HOST.3
Who are you ?@15
Where are we ?@81
What's this "SOUL" you keep talking about ?@100
BEGIN OTHER
Oh that's right, I never introduced myself !
So, I'm EXolotl MÜÜSKE.
REVEAL
I run an experiment that you agreed on participate to.
Hey, you really seem to don't remember anything about your past life, right ?
BEGIN HOST.2
Not really, I don't even remember who I am...@24
Hum, let me think...@57
BEGIN OTHER
Yeah, seems like a huge part of your memory data was lost in the transfer.
We'll fix that later, I promise.
BEGIN OTHER
Well, if you don't have any questions, maybe we can proceed ?
BEGIN HOST.3
Where are we ?@33
Can you explain the SOUL ?@52
Proceed.@55
BEGIN OTHER
The goal of the experiment is to transfer a human consciousness into a virtual metaverse.
Right now, your consciousness has been transfered to computer data.
That's why I'm talking to you with text messages.
BEGIN HOST.2
What happened to my body ?@40
Will I stay like that forever ?@49
BEGIN OTHER
Your body is fine, it's in a "comma" state as long as your SOUL is out.
All of this will end when the experiment finishes.
BEGIN OTHER
So, let's proceed, shall we ?
We'll now try to retrieve this data that you seem to miss.
I'll be with you all along, don't worry !
Well, let's begin !
TEST.2
BEGIN OTHER
No don't worry, you'll return to your body as soon as we finish this experiment.
We'll also gonna create a virtual body for you to live inside the metaverse !@43
BEGIN OTHER
Oh, well it's complicated...
I myself don't understand it perfectly, that's why we're doing these experiments !@43
BEGIN OTHER
Oh you're not wasting time, I like that !@43
HURT
BEGIN OTHER
Wait stop ! Your SOUL is weakening !
BEGIN HOST.3
What's this SOUL you're talking about ?@52
Why is that ?@64
Come on, I seem to remember something...@69
BEGIN OTHER
Well, some data about your existence seem to have corrupted during the transfer.
It's safer for now to avoid trying to access this data...
If your SOUL shatters, you'll instantly die...
Believe me, I know this scenario too well...@27
HURT
BEGIN OTHER
No Frisk, you really need to stop exploring this part of your memory !!
BEGIN HOST.2
What do you mean by that ?@64
I'm getting closer...@75

We should talk about that later, do you rather have another question ?
