Oh Frisk, you're back !
Did you recovered all your SOUL fragments ?
BEGIN HOST.3
I'm Frisk Tale, 13 years old (...)@10
Where's Chara, EXolotl ?@42
Yeah, can I leave now ?@57
BEGIN OTHER
Oh great, seemed the transfer worked at last !
Thank you so much, Frisk !
We did great progress towards REDEMPTION thanks to you !
BEGIN HOST.1
Can I go home now ?@16
BEGIN OTHER
Well...
I know you had to navigate between all of our computers to find your fragments.
I know which information you had access to during your trip.
And you see...
I can't be sure all of our experiments would stay confidential after you leave...
BEGIN HOST.2
So what, you're gonna kill me ?@25
...@25
BEGIN OTHER
You'll continue to be our test subject.
At least until our experiments are fully complete.
I'm afraid you're not the one who makes decisions here...
We're good ?
BEGIN HOST.3
Curse you, EXolotl !@34
Proceed...@34
...@34
BEGIN OTHER
Well, it's not as if this anwser would change anything.
Let's continue, shall we ?
The next step is to test if your SOUL can live in another body.
Then, we'll be able to put you in our beta metaverse to see how you're doing.
You're ready ?
Here we go !
CONCLUSION
BEGIN OTHER
Hum, At least you're not hiding all of what you learned during your trip.
That's what I feared...
Oh well...
As for Chara, I'm afraid you know the anwser Frisk...

Well, you obviously know more than you should.
